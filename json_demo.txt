Outdoor play can be important for our social and physical well-being and moreover helps us to connect to space, place and environment. Of course, the CHI community continues to explore play across many contexts; however, specifically designing for outdoor play remains underexplored. This workshop aims to bring together those who are interested in technological, social and design aspects of outdoor play for all ages. We will use participants' insights, energies and expertise to explore the challenges and focus on how we can build a community to share innovative designs, generate knowledge and make actionable research in this context.","keywords":"Outdoor play; open-ended play; pervasive play; pervasive games","authors":[{"name":"Gavin Wood","authorId":"0b1c7fb1061cb074484ebbf96d49d678cfd80dac67ada2cc1e1f8e7ab7cd7983","affiliation":"Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Gavin","middleName":"","lastName":"Wood"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Northumbria University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Jon Back","authorId":"0d71df1b41c4150f8f611c91c570f386610f5a0eb5d8bb00cd630d17aeecb048","affiliation":"Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Jon","middleName":"","lastName":"Back"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Uppsala University","city":"Uppsala","state":"","country":"Sweden"}}},{"name":"Jaz Hee-jeong Choi","authorId":"e9ce88833990c3712ba16831fb06d73b0fa3cd42e1aea823700b1569e85b7c18","affiliation":"RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Jaz","middleName":"Hee-jeong","lastName":"Choi"},"affiliation":{"institution":"RMIT University","city":"Melbourne","state":"","country":"Australia"}}},{"name":"Thomas Dylan","authorId":"ac1732a6ca8176fa03a0e9466128ae72e74cd9654a1ef20463227ebf37b07147","affiliation":"Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Dylan"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Northumbria University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Marti Louw","authorId":"f0605afced59c266a5c00a1b7020c55e520ccce6e675042789e6d98efd0fedc1","affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Marti","middleName":"","lastName":"Louw"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Carnegie Mellon University","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"PA","country":"USA"}}}]}]}
