The meeting started an ongoing dialogue that recognizes the fact that HCI is still in its infancy in the Arab world and explores challenges and opportunities for shaping the future of HCI in the region. The meeting was further followed by three successful meetings in SIGCHI sponsored events that included general discussions about the state of HCI research in Arab countries, and a thematic discussion on exploring participatory design practices with Arab communities. In this workshop, we build on the momentum generated by our previous meetings, and attempt to draw a roadmap for HCI research and practice in Arab world. Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss case studies from their own work, share experiences and lessons learned, and envision the future of the field in this area. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through various social and scholarly channels.","keywords":"Arab; Community; Design; HCI","authors":[{"name":"Ebtisam Alabdulqader","authorId":"2955511de1785520bd7838d5dc83dfed9c13e268d2cd2e0c74c3e23bff38ec6c","affiliation":"King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Ebtisam","middleName":"","lastName":"Alabdulqader"},"affiliation":{"institution":"King Saud University","city":"Riyadh","state":"","country":"Saudi Arabia"}}},{"name":"Shaimaa Lazem","authorId":"83511fd396c0757e68a9ff328d1a971ddba63b691d6934c5c3d410dd76e097d2","affiliation":"City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications, New Borg El-Arab, Egypt","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Shaimaa","middleName":"","lastName":"Lazem"},"affiliation":{"institution":"City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications","city":"New Borg El-Arab","state":"Alexandria","country":"Egypt"}}},{"name":"Soud Nassir","authorId":"57b7c77f298d18af2cd6e43a12c54530c6c31940c23ae30ce6ff3cff5f1db00f","affiliation":"University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Soud","middleName":"","lastName":"Nassir"},"affiliation":{"institution":"University of Technology Sydney","city":"Sydney","state":"","country":"Australia"}}},{"name":"Mennatallah Saleh","authorId":"a4f4402916a6ac2316ce0806fcbd1a9aeefaa1a00a99b1a937097eb71aa4ea3f","affiliation":"Technical University inBerlin, Berlin, Germany","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Mennatallah","middleName":"","lastName":"Saleh"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Technical University inBerlin","city":"Berlin","state":"","country":"Germany"}}},{"name":"Sarah Armoush","authorId":"d916747f5d671b4d07b138683463507721015370f212289a0245eb3fd775ef56","affiliation":"Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Sarah","middleName":"","lastName":"Armoush"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Newcastle University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Susan Dray","authorId":"59ea3c9a71c621d2f15521f4d424a207810019c64a7ae547b8a794cf79936e6c","affiliation":"Dray & Associates, Minneapolis, MN, USA","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Susan","middleName":"","lastName":"Dray"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Dray & Associates","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","country":"USA"}}}]}]}
