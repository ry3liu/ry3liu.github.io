Outdoor play can be important for our social and physical well-being and moreover helps us to connect to space, place and environment. Of course, the CHI community continues to explore play across many contexts; however, specifically designing for outdoor play remains underexplored. This workshop aims to bring together those who are interested in technological, social and design aspects of outdoor play for all ages. We will use participants' insights, energies and expertise to explore the challenges and focus on how we can build a community to share innovative designs, generate knowledge and make actionable research in this context.","keywords":"Outdoor play; open-ended play; pervasive play; pervasive games","authors":[{"name":"Gavin Wood","authorId":"0b1c7fb1061cb074484ebbf96d49d678cfd80dac67ada2cc1e1f8e7ab7cd7983","affiliation":"Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Gavin","middleName":"","lastName":"Wood"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Northumbria University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Jon Back","authorId":"0d71df1b41c4150f8f611c91c570f386610f5a0eb5d8bb00cd630d17aeecb048","affiliation":"Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Jon","middleName":"","lastName":"Back"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Uppsala University","city":"Uppsala","state":"","country":"Sweden"}}},{"name":"Jaz Hee-jeong Choi","authorId":"e9ce88833990c3712ba16831fb06d73b0fa3cd42e1aea823700b1569e85b7c18","affiliation":"RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Jaz","middleName":"Hee-jeong","lastName":"Choi"},"affiliation":{"institution":"RMIT University","city":"Melbourne","state":"","country":"Australia"}}},{"name":"Thomas Dylan","authorId":"ac1732a6ca8176fa03a0e9466128ae72e74cd9654a1ef20463227ebf37b07147","affiliation":"Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Dylan"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Northumbria University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Marti Louw","authorId":"f0605afced59c266a5c00a1b7020c55e520ccce6e675042789e6d98efd0fedc1","affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Marti","middleName":"","lastName":"Louw"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Carnegie Mellon University","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"PA","country":"USA"}}}]}]},{"sessionId":"114bb4e367405499de09263dbe27858719168cfd1c44a7244dda4ee95e29d767","title":"With an Eye to the Future: HCI Research and Practice in the Arab World","venue":"workshop","type":"workshop","room":"Alsh 2","time":"08:00:00","hasAward":false,"chair":"TBA","chairId":null,"hasChair":false,"chairable":false,"venueIcon":"group","venueDescription":"Workshop","submissions":[{"paperId":"ws2121","programmeId":"W02","title":"With an Eye to the Future: HCI Practice and Research in the Arab World1","doi":"10.1145/3290607.3299006","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3299006","award":false,"hm":false,"abstract":"ArabHCI initiative was inaugurated in a CHI17 SIG Meeting that brought together 45+ HCI Arab/non-Arab researchers/practitioners who are conducting/interested in HCI within Arab communities. The meeting started an ongoing dialogue that recognizes the fact that HCI is still in its infancy in the Arab world and explores challenges and opportunities for shaping the future of HCI in the region. The meeting was further followed by three successful meetings in SIGCHI sponsored events that included general discussions about the state of HCI research in Arab countries, and a thematic discussion on exploring participatory design practices with Arab communities. In this workshop, we build on the momentum generated by our previous meetings, and attempt to draw a roadmap for HCI research and practice in Arab world. Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss case studies from their own work, share experiences and lessons learned, and envision the future of the field in this area. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through various social and scholarly channels.","keywords":"Arab; Community; Design; HCI","authors":[{"name":"Ebtisam Alabdulqader","authorId":"2955511de1785520bd7838d5dc83dfed9c13e268d2cd2e0c74c3e23bff38ec6c","affiliation":"King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Ebtisam","middleName":"","lastName":"Alabdulqader"},"affiliation":{"institution":"King Saud University","city":"Riyadh","state":"","country":"Saudi Arabia"}}},{"name":"Shaimaa Lazem","authorId":"83511fd396c0757e68a9ff328d1a971ddba63b691d6934c5c3d410dd76e097d2","affiliation":"City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications, New Borg El-Arab, Egypt","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Shaimaa","middleName":"","lastName":"Lazem"},"affiliation":{"institution":"City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications","city":"New Borg El-Arab","state":"Alexandria","country":"Egypt"}}},{"name":"Soud Nassir","authorId":"57b7c77f298d18af2cd6e43a12c54530c6c31940c23ae30ce6ff3cff5f1db00f","affiliation":"University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Soud","middleName":"","lastName":"Nassir"},"affiliation":{"institution":"University of Technology Sydney","city":"Sydney","state":"","country":"Australia"}}},{"name":"Mennatallah Saleh","authorId":"a4f4402916a6ac2316ce0806fcbd1a9aeefaa1a00a99b1a937097eb71aa4ea3f","affiliation":"Technical University inBerlin, Berlin, Germany","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Mennatallah","middleName":"","lastName":"Saleh"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Technical University inBerlin","city":"Berlin","state":"","country":"Germany"}}},{"name":"Sarah Armoush","authorId":"d916747f5d671b4d07b138683463507721015370f212289a0245eb3fd775ef56","affiliation":"Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Sarah","middleName":"","lastName":"Armoush"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Newcastle University","city":"Newcastle upon Tyne","state":"","country":"United Kingdom"}}},{"name":"Susan Dray","authorId":"59ea3c9a71c621d2f15521f4d424a207810019c64a7ae547b8a794cf79936e6c","affiliation":"Dray & Associates, Minneapolis, MN, USA","raw":{"name":{"firstName":"Susan","middleName":"","lastName":"Dray"},"affiliation":{"institution":"Dray & Associates","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","country":"USA"}}}]}]}
